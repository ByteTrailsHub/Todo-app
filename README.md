# Todo list
## Introduction
A simple to-do list

### Motivation
Hello and welcome to my GitHub! ðŸ‘‹

I've always been fascinated by the world of coding, but it took me a while to finally take the leap and start learning. Now, I've fully embraced the journey, and I'm excited to build, experiment, and grow my skills one project at a time.

I'm starting with small hands-on projects to gain practical experience, and as I progress, I aim to expand my knowledge and dive deeper into more complex challenges. This is just the beginning, and Iâ€™m eager to learn, collaborate, and contribute to the open-source community.

Follow along as I explore the world of code! âœ¨
